# harbor-getting-started

Harbor is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. Harbor, a CNCF Graduated project, delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to help you consistently and securely manage artifacts across cloud native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.

## 🚀 Features

- **Harbor**: A self-hosted cloud-native registry that stores, scans, and signs content such as container images and OCI artifacts, including Helm charts. It extends the open-source CNCF Distribution project by adding useful functionality like user management, security, activity auditing, and role-based access control (RBAC) 1. Essentially, Harbor provides compliance, performance, and interoperability, making it easier to consistently and securely manage images across cloud-native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.
